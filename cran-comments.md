# cder 0.1-0.

Resubmission to address CRAN comments:

*  Wrote package names, software names and API names in single quotes (e.g. 'CDEC') in Title and Description.
* Corrected typo in description: California DataExchange Center --> California Data Exchange Center
* Added more details about the functionality of this API in the Description text.



## Test environments

* Local Windows 10 install, R 3.6.0
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R-oldrel, R-release, R-devel

Because the CDEC Web API requires an internet connection, examples 
are only run interactively. 

## R CMD check results
